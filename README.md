[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/be2bill/cms-configuration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/be2bill/cms-configuration)

WARNING: THIS IS A ALPHA VERSION! (still in specification process)

This project defines a standard configuration for Be2bill CMS modules.
This project is maintained by Be2bill and Quadra-Informatique.

Actually it includes 2 files:
- configuration.xml => The CMS feature map to use to handle Be2bill API (to be completed)
- parameter_reference.xml => The exhaustive list of Be2bill parameters (to be completed)

You can even be a contributor by pushing a push request.
